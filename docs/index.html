					<h1>What are fighting games?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fighting games are a genre of video games where two players battle against each other through a specific type of interface.
						</li>
						<li>
							The players each control one on-screen game character with about equal power or strength through a sequence of in-game movements
							 triggered by button presses or joystick movements. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Players usually employ certain combos to perform different actions for their characters. These various sequences of combinations
							 are techniques and strategies different players utilize to win their games. 
						</li>

					<h1>What is the fighting game community?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The Fighting Game Community (commonly referred to as the FGC) is a community of people who play fighting
							games at a competitive level. This means such members would spend time and effort to gain a deep understanding
							of the game they play to compete with others
						</li>
						<li>
							Players within the fighting game community also hold their tournaments worldwide. One such tournament is the
							Evolution Championship Series (EVO) World Finals, held yearly, and considered one of the most significant
							fighting game tournaments worldwide.

						</li>
						<li>
							Within this community of fighting game players lies a rich vocabulary of words exclusive to the people who
							play in this competitive space. The words or terms are exclusive in that people outside the community
							typically will not understand the term's meaning in the context in which it is used.
