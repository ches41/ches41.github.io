                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The two most important qualifications for a commentator were straightforward: an understanding of the game being commented
                            on and the capacity to do it in an engaging way. The ability to distinguish one caster from another was also greatly aided
                            by personality. In both cases, these were the same for both conventional and esports analysis. Giving a running commentary
                            of a game or match is the responsibility of a commentator or caster for a broadcast. They must put the viewer's attention
                            on what is happening at any given moment.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Casting, sometimes known as shoutcasting, is the process of explaining what is happening during a match or game in such
                            a way that viewers can follow the action and understand what is happening at any particular moment. Additionally, the
                            broadcaster needs to be able to engage the audience and make the broadcast entertaining. They effectively serve as home
                            viewers' entertainment, making the game entertaining to watch.

                    Here is an example of a clip showing how commentators or casters utilize the language to teach the audience on what is happening
                    in the game as well as to entertain. In the video, you can hear the casters use terms like &quot;anti-air,&quot; which refers to attacks
                    that are optimized for hitting opponents who are airborne, &quot;confirm,&quot; which describes making sure your opponent was hit by a move
                    before proceeding with more attacks, &quot;V-shift,&quot; which is a defensive technique used to parry an attack and get away from the
                    opponent, and lastly, the V-Trigger, which varies based on the character and is activated by simultaneously hitting the Heavy
                    Punch and Heavy Kick buttons, among many other terms.
